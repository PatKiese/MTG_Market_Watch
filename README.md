# MTG_Market_Watch

## Data pipeline for a pricing analysis on Magic the Gathering cards
MTG_Market_Watch collects secondary market prices of Magic the Gathering cards from the [scrfall API](https://https://scryfall.com/docs/api) and analyses data to detect rapid 
pricing increases ("spikes") within a give time (usualy twice a week).

## TODO's and known issues
- Adding more descriptions to the code and to this ReadMe :)
- Introducing OOP principles for better structure and encapsulation. Right now the code is more or less a collection of methods and scripts.
- Slim down the css part. Currently using a template from [html5up.net](https://html5up.net)
